# Findings
1. "demo-8-11k-s-adpcm.wav.xgz" from a hex editor in 16mflash.bin. Knowing the name, i'd expect it to be the menu music used for these boards.
2. All of the roms in xgz format with them following "xZIP" before a lot of data. This could be a lead.
3. More sounds ending with "-adpcm.wav.xgz" which are presumably the sound effects.
4. Some things when playing around with the rom seem to turn up with... Raiden 2's sound driver? I mean, I highly doubt it, but it's possible.
